## Running Locally

To run GuildWeb locally on your machine, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

* GuildWeb requires Node.js version 20.11.1. If you haven't installed Node.js and npm yet, you can download them from [Node.js official website](https://nodejs.org/). You can check your Node.js versions by running:
  ```bash
  node --version
  ```
* [MySQL database server](https://www.mysql.com/) installed locally or accessible remotely. 

### Installation
Before you start, ensure you have Node.js and npm installed on your machine.

Clone the repository from GitHub and navigate to the project directory:
  ```
  git clone https://github.com/meatballyun/GuildWeb.git
  ```

Install backend dependencies:
  ```
  cd backend
  npm install
  ```

Install frontend dependencies:
  ```
  cd frontend
  npm install
  ```

### Configuration

1. Set up the MySQL database:
  - Create a MySQL database with the name `guildweb`.
  - Update the database connection configuration in `backend/lib/db.js` if necessary.
2. Set environment variables: Create a `.env` file in the root of the backend directory and add the following variables:
    ```.ENV
    # Environment
    NODE_ENV=development

    # Database
    DB_HOST=localhost
    DB_NAME=guildweb
    DB_USER=root
    DB_PASS=your_mysql_root_password

    # Session
    SESSION_SECRET=your_session_secret

    # JWT
    JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret

    # Mail
    MAIL_USER=your_email_username
    MAIL_PASS=your_email_password

    # Server
    PORT=3010

    # URL
    FE_URL=http://localhost:3000

    # Path
    UPLOAD_PATH=uploads
    ```

    Ensure you replace `your_mysql_root_password` with your MySQL root password and other placeholders with appropriate values relevant to your setup.
